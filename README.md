# classifying-with-knn-diabetes
A k-nearest neighbors exercise with diabetes dataset which is provided by mclust package 


## About

In this exercise, we make a basic machine learning model by using k-nearest neighbors algorithm (knn) with **diabetes** dataset.
It is used 3 different cross-validations : 
- Holdout cross-validation
- k Fold cross-validation
- Leave-one-out cross validation

Then, we train the model and get almost 90% accuracy. The model we created is used to make predictions with a basic example.
